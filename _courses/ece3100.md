title: "Introduction to Probability and Inference for Random Signals and Systems"
credits: 4
primary_level: 3
tags: [Probability, Modeling]
overview: >
  This course is an introduction to modeling and analysis of random phenomena and processes, including the basics of statistical inference in the presence of uncertainty. Topics include probability models, combinatorics, countable and uncountable sample spaces, discrete random variables, probability mass functions, continuous random variables, probability density functions, cumulative distribution functions, expectation and variance, independence and correlation, conditioning and Bayess rule, concentration inequalities, the multivariate Normal distribution, limit theorems (including the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem), Monte Carlo methods, random processes, and the basics of statistical inference. Applications to communications, networking, circuit design, computer engineering, finance, and voting will be discussed throughout the semester.
prerequisites: "MATH 2940 and PHYS 2213, or equivalent."
key_topics: ["Probability models", "Random Variables", "Combinatorics"]

professors:
  - name: "Dr. Qing Zhao"
    semesters: "Spring"
    difficulty: 3/5
    rating: 4/5
    assignments: "Weekly assignments (total 12 sets). Collaboration with students is encouraged."
    exams: "Two prelims and one final exam."
    pros:
      - "Must-take if you are interested in the math side of ECE, which spans signal processing, information theory, AI/ML, and more"
      - "Extremely well organized and well run"
    cons:
      - "Easy to fall behind because the material starts out fairly simply but becomes significantly more complicated later on in the course."
      - "More theoretical feel than the other options for 3000-level ECE courses"
