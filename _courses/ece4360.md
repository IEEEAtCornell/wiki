title: "Nanofabrication and Characterization of Electronics"
codes:
  - "ECE 4360"
credits: 3
tags: [Materials, Semiconductors, Electronics]
overview: >
  This course serves as an introduction to modern nanofabrication technologies with emphasis on integrated circuits manufacturing. It uses thermal budget, scaling of geometry, pitch and registry and control of parametric yield will be used for integration guidelines. Lectures cover physical principles and process modeling and labs  include a series of fabrication steps of lithography, metallization, plasma etching and annealing to produce semiconductor devices (Schottky diodes, pn junction diodes, MOS capacitors, and MOSFETs).
prerequisites: "MSE 2620 or ECE 3150, or equivalent that covers basics on semiconductors and semiconductor devices, MATH 2930-MATH 2940, CHEM 2090."
