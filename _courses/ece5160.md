codes:
  - "ECE 5160"
credits: 4
tags: [Robotics, Python]
overview: >
  This is a 5000-level version of ECE 4160, which involves additional (and more challenging) assignments in half the labs. The course focuses systems level design and implementation of fast and dynamic autonomous robots. Students will be able to design a fast autonomous car, explore dynamic behaviors, acting forces, sensors, and reactive control on an embedded processor, as well as some partial off-board computation. The course focuses on deriving design specifications from abstract problem descriptions and gaining familiarity with rapid prototyping techniques, system debugging, system evaluation, and online dissemination of work.
