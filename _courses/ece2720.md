codes:
  - "ECE 2720"
credits: 4
tags: [Data science, Python]
overview: >
  This course is an introduction to data science for engineers. The data science workflow: acquisition and cleansing, exploration and modeling, prediction and decision making, visualization and presentation. Tools for data science including numerical optimization, the Discrete Fourier Transform, Principal Component Analysis, and probability with a focus on statistical inference and correlation methods. Techniques for different steps in the workflow including outlier detection, filtering, regression, classification, and techniques for avoiding overfitting. Methods for combining domain-agnostic data analysis tools with the types of domain-specific knowledge that are common in engineering. Ethical considerations. Optional topics include classification via neural networks, outlier detection, and Markov chains. Programming projects are in Python.

professors:
  - name: "Dr. Jayadev Acharya"
    semesters: "Fall, Spring"
    difficulty: 4/5
    rating: 3/5
    assignments: "Weekly problem sets, and biweekly labs and pre-lab assignments."
    exams: "Two prelims and one final exam."
    pros:
      - "Practical projects that apply theoretical knowledge."
      - "Well-structured lectures and clear explanations of complex concepts."
      - "Comprehensive and organized course materials."
    cons:
      - "Heavy workload that requires significant time investment each week."
      - "Challenging exams that require deep understanding."
    tips:
      - "Make sure to review lectures regularly."
      - "Start working on the projects early; they take more time than expected."
      - "Attend office hours and study groups to tackle difficult topics."

  - name: "Dr. Vikram Krishnamurthy"
    semesters: "Spring"
    difficulty: 2.5/5
    rating: 4.5/5
    assignments: "Problem sets (involve math and Python programming for simulating)"
    exams: "10 minute quiz at the beginning of almost every lecture, one take-home final"
    pros:
      - "Quizzes are very fair and help you stay on top of the material"
      - "Well-structured lectures and some overlap (especially for probability and random variable section) with classes like CS2800 and ECE 3100"
      - "Professor cares about students and designs class to not be too stressful"
    cons:
      - "Need to stay on top of it for quizzes"
      - "Material can be repetitive depending on what other classes you have taken"
    tips:
      - "Office hours are usually not very packed (especially towards the start of an assignment's release date), so take advantage of them"
      - "Knowledge of linear algebra (eigenvectors and eigenvalues) are helpful for understanding the material, but professor will re-teach it from first principles during lecture"
