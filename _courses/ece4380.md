overview: >
  This course provides a senior-level introduction to electromagnetic and optical metamaterials. Topics include electromagnetic and optical properties of surface plasmons and polaritons, artificial magnetic materials, negative-index materials, nanostructured optical materials, etc. The course also discusses the applications of these materials in diverse areas including electromagnetic cloaking and invisibility, stealth technologies, optical super-lensing, bio-chemical sensing, conformal optics, meta-surfaces, and non-reciprocal devices.
