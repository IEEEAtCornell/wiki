overview: >
  This course looks at how network systems pervade our society in both social and technological contexts, like performance and resilience properties of large-scale multi-agent systems, such as the electric power grids, the internet of things, traffic or robotic sensor networks. Students will learn  how to mathematically describe network interactions, analyze linear and nonlinear dynamics over networks, and understand and analyze strategic behavior over networks.
