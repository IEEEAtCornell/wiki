layout: class
title: "Analog Integrated Circuit Design"
codes:
  - "ECE 4530"
credits: 4
primary_level: 4
tags: [Analog Circuit Design]
overview: >
  Overview of devices available to analog integrated-circuit designers in modern CMOS and BiCMOS processes: resistors, capacitors, MOS transistors, and bipolar transistors. Basic building blocks for linear analog integrated circuits: single-stage amplifiers, current mirrors, and differential pairs. Transistor-level design of linear analog integrated circuits, such as operational amplifiers and operational transconductance amplifiers. Layout techniques for analog integrated circuits. Throughout the course, emphasis is placed on design-oriented analysis techniques.
prerequisites: "ECE 3150 and 2100 or equivalent"
key_topics: ["Analog Circuit Design", "Integrated Circuits"]

professors:
  - name: "Professor Alyosha Molnar"
    semesters: "Fall"
    difficulty: 4/5
    rating: 3.5/5
    assignments: "Problem sets every other week, about 4 circuit labs, final project in a group of 3-5 students"
    exams: "Review exam, midterm, final"
    pros:
      - "Must take if you are interested in the analog side of ECE."
      - "You cover a lot of material and learn how to physically design analog chips using Cadence Virtuoso."
    cons:
      - "One student said the workload for this class was the highest I've experienced at Cornell."
    tips:
      - "Start things early and ask for help so you don't fall behind."
