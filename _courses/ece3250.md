overview: >
  Course aims to provide students with a rigorous treatment of the fundamentals of discrete- and continuous-time signals and systems. The course makes use of sophisticated tools such as vector spaces of signals (e.g. bounded, summable, and square-summable signals) and orthogonal expansions in Hilbert space in addition to covering standard material on time- and frequency-domain analysis of signals and systems, including discrete- and continuous-time convolution, Fourier series, continuous- and discrete-time Fourier transforms, sampling theory, the DFT and FFT, and spectrograms. Homework assignments include a computational component where appropriate.
prerequisites: "MATH 2930, MATH 2940, Basic knowledge of Python programming"
key_topics: ["Math", "Python"]

professors:
  - name: "Dr. David Delchamps"
    semesters: "Fall"
    difficulty: 2.5/5
    rating: 5/5
    assignments: "Weekly problem sets (not super long) and bi-weekly python programming 'labs' (not super long either)"
    exams: "Two prelims and one final exam. Exams are mostly 'true/false' and are very fair."
    pros:
      - "Well-structured lectures and clear explanations of complex concepts."
      - "Delchamps is an engaging lecturer"
    cons:
      - "Largely theoretical/general/mathematical."
    tips:
      - 'For exams, make sure to pay attention to the "directionality" of implications proven in class (i.e. "implies") vs. "iff".'
