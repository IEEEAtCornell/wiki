overview: >
  This class serves as an introduction to optical waveguides and photonic devices. Topics include optical wave propagation in uniform media and at interfaces, gaussian beams and diffraction, modes, dispersion, and fundamental relations/symmetries, interferometers and resonators, guided waves in optical fibers and planar dielectric systems, perturbation theory, coupling of modes, adiabatic variation, and parallels to quantum phenomena, electro- and acousto-optics and a survey of system applications, including photonic interconnects and quantum technologies.
