overview: >
  This course is an introduction to electronic circuits. It begins with basic quantities used to characterize circuit operation (like current, voltage, and power) and then enforces several physical laws of circuit analysis. The material includes passive circuit elements such as resistors, inductors, and capacitors under constant dc, transient, and sinusoidal steady-state conditions. Active components including transistors and Op-Amps are also introduced and used to build simple amplifiers and switching power converters. Students learn to utilize concepts like Laplace transforms and associated transfer functions for circuit analysis. In the lab part of the course, students learn how to use modern instruments to test circuits and develop some simple modeling software in MATLAB to numerically predict the results from analysis and experiment.
