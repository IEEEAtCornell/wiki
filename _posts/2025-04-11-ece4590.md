overview: >
  This course provides fundamental understanding of processing/structure/property relation in thin films, with an emphasis on behaviors that differ from those observed in classical bulk materials. Topics include vacuum technology, deposition techniques, surface energies, surface kinetics, nucleation and growth, homoepitaxy, heteroepitaxy, microstructure, stress in thin films, and electromigration.
