permalink: /classes/4000/ece4150/
credits: 4
tags: [GPS, Data Modeling, Receiver and Antenna Characteristics]
overview: >
  This course provides an introduction and analysis of GPS operating principles. Its topics include GPS satellite orbital dynamics, navigation data modeling, position/navigation/timing solution algorithm, receiver and antenna characteristics, analysis of error and accuracy, and differential GPS. The course consists of lectures and labs, with an asynchronous lab section. Assignments include both analytical problems and Matlab prelaboratory exercises.
prerequisites: "Basic knowledge of Matlab, 3000-level engineering course with advanced math content (e.g., ECE 3030 or MAE 3260)"
key_topics: ["Orbital Dynamics", "Navigation Solution Algorithm", "Differential GPS"]

    rating: 5/5
    assignments: "Weekly problem sets and prelabs, weekly or biweekly lab reports."
    exams: "One prelim and one final exam."
    pros:
      - "Useful laboratory sections that apply lecture materials."
      - "Well-structured lectures and clear explanations of complex concepts that follow the textbook."
      - "Timely grading and posting on laboratory solutions, which helps with the following labs."
    cons:
      - "Relatively heavy workload that requires staying on top of deadlines."
      - "Could be easy to fall behind due to the number of assignments."
    tips:
      - "Attend lectures since they make following the textbook easier."
      - "Make sure to stay on top of the assignments, especially laboratory preparation."
