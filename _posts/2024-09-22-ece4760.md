overview: >
  This course focuses on the design of real-time digital systems using microprocessor-based embedded controllers. Students work in pairs to design, debug, and construct several small systems that illustrate and employ the techniques of digital system design acquired in previous courses. The class is primarily laboratory work, and lectures are used for the introduction of examples, description of specific modules to be designed, and instruction in the hardware and high-level design tools to be employed. This is a culminating design experience (CDE) course.
