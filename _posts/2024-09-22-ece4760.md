overview: >
  This course focuses on the design of real-time digital systems using microprocessor-based embedded controllers. Students work in pairs to design, debug, and construct several small systems that illustrate and employ the techniques of digital system design acquired in previous courses. The class is primarily laboratory work, and lectures are used for the introduction of examples, description of specific modules to be designed, and instruction in the hardware and high-level design tools to be employed. This is a culminating design experience (CDE) course.
prerequisites: "ECE 3140/CS 3420"
key_topics: ["Digital Systems", "Controllers"]

professors:
  - name: "Dr. Van Adams"
    semesters: "Spring"
    assignments: "Weekly labs and a final project. No homework or exams."
    pros:
      - "Professor Adams is very passionate and helpful."
      - "Labs are educational, engaging, and fun."
    cons:
      - "Labs can become stressful if you fall behind or run into a hard to crack bug."
      - "Lectures are not terribly useful to the labs themselves, yet Adams is passionate about what he is teaching."
    tips:
      - "You may/should attend other lab sections in order to finish your check off. Later labs cannot be completed in a single session."
    difficulty: 3.5/5
