overview: >
  Topics in C include procedural programming, and analysis and practical implementation of basic data structures and algorithms. Topics in C++ explore object-oriented, generic, functional, and concurrent programming, and tnen transition to advanced data structures and algorithms involving trees, tables, and graphs while using the POSIX standard library. The course includes a series of programming assignments.
