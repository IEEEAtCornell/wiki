overview: >
  The course focuses systems level design and implementation of fast and dynamic autonomous robots. Students will be able to design a fast autonomous car, explore dynamic behaviors, acting forces, sensors, and reactive control on an embedded processor, as well as some partial off-board computation. The course focuses on deriving design specifications from abstract problem descriptions and gaining familiarity with rapid prototyping techniques, system debugging, system evaluation, and online dissemination of work.
