credits: 4
tags: [Linux, Embedded Systems]
overview: >
  This course focuses on design of microcontroller based systems using embedded Linux, with emphasis will be on application and Linux programming skills, processor and microcontroller architecture with some discussion of hardware interfaces. Student teams design and debug example solutions on a target microcontroller (for example, Raspberry Pi) during lab sessions. Students create a final, end-of-semester project using the microcontroller platform and development techniques discussed during the semester.
prerequisites: "Prerequisite: ECE 3140/CS 3420, ECE 3400 strongly recommended."
