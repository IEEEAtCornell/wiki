  This is a 5000-level version of ECE 4180. Students enrolled in ECE 4180 have less of a workload, they are required to do three out of the four labs, they are not required to do one assignment, and their competition is in simulation. This course gives an overview of the challenges faced and techniques used for creating autonomous mobile robots. Topics include: sensing, localization, mapping, path planning, motion planning, obstacle and collision avoidance and multi-robot control. The course includes a lab portion in which students program the iRobot Create.
