overview: >
  This course is an introduction to data science for engineers. The data science workflow: acquisition and cleansing, exploration and modeling, prediction and decision making, visualization and presentation. Tools for data science including numerical optimization, the Discrete Fourier Transform, Principal Component Analysis, and probability with a focus on statistical inference and correlation methods. Techniques for different steps in the workflow including outlier detection, filtering, regression, classification, and techniques for avoiding overfitting. Methods for combining domain-agnostic data analysis tools with the types of domain-specific knowledge that are common in engineering. Ethical considerations. Optional topics include classification via neural networks, outlier detection, and Markov chains. Programming projects are in Python.
prerequisites: "Basic knowledge of calculus (MATH 1920 or PHYS 1112), MATH 2930 and PHYS 2213 are highly recommended as pre/corequesites"
key_topics: ["Numerical Optimization", "Fourier Analysis", "Data Analysis"]
