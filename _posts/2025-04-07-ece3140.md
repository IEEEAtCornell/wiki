overview: >
  This course provides an introduction to the design of embedded systems, with an emphasis on understanding the interaction between hardware, software, and the physical world. Topics include assembly language programming, interrupts, I/O, concurrency management, scheduling, resource management, and real-time constraints.
prerequisites: "ECE 2300/ENGRD 2300, recommended prerequisite: ECE 2400/ENGRD 2140"
key_topics: ["embedded systems, assembly, C, interrupts, I/O, scheduling"]

professors:
  - name: "Dr. Nils Napp"
    semesters: "Spring"
    difficulty: N/A
    rating: N/A
    assignments: "Weekly graded quizzes related to lectures. Lab assignments due roughly every two weeks (one week for prelab and one week for lab). First few lab assignments are individual but later lab assignments are with a randomized partner in your discussion."
    exams: "Open-ended final project (1-3 members per group)."
    tips: 
    - "For thoese considering an CS major or CS minor, take the class under the code CS3420. This class is cross-listed as both CS3420 and ECE3140, but the CS department cares which code you take the class under for satisifying requirements. The ECE department does not care. "
    - "Start labs early. Office hours queues can get long before the deadline."
