tags: [Digital Logic, Verilog]
overview: >
  This course provides an introduction to the design and implementation of digital circuits and microprocessors. Topics include transistor network design, Boolean algebra, combinational circuits, sequential circuits, finite state machine design, processor pipelines, and memory hierarchy. Design methodology using both discrete components and hardware description languages is covered in the laboratory portion of the course.
prerequisites: "Basic knowledge of programming (CS 1110 or 1112)"
key_topics: ["Boolean & Digital Logic", "Verilog", "ROM & RAM Memory", "Memory Hierarchies"]

professors:
  - name: "Dr. Zhiru Zhang"
    semesters: "Spring"
    difficulty: 3.5/5
    rating: 4.7/5
    assignments: "Weekly problem sets and lab activities (2 lab reports towards the end of the semester)."
    exams: "Two prelims and one final exam."
    pros:
      - "Practical projects that apply theoretical knowledge."
      - "Well-structured lectures and clear explanations of complex concepts."
      - "Comprehensive and organized course materials."
    cons:
      - "Heavy workload that requires significant time investment each week."
      - "Challenging exams that require deep understanding."
    tips:
      - "Make sure to review lectures regularly."
      - "Start working on the projects early; they take more time than expected."
      - "Attend office hours and study groups to tackle difficult topics."

  - name: "Dr. Christopher Batten"
    pros:
      - "Strong emphasis on hardware design principles."
      - "Challenging but well-structured labs."
      - "Provides great real-world applications of digital logic."
    cons:
      - "Exams are tough and require a deep conceptual understanding."
      - "Lectures can be fast-paced; reviewing notes is crucial."
    reviews:
      - author: "Student C"
        content: "One of the best-organized courses I’ve taken. The labs were intense but rewarding."
      - author: "Student D"
        content: "Dr. Batten’s lectures are insightful, but you need to stay on top of the material."
    tips:
      - "Don’t fall behind on labs; they build on each other."
      - "Understand the theoretical concepts before jumping into the hardware implementation."
      - "Form a study group to discuss problem sets and labs."
