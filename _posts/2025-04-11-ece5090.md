overview: >
  This is a 5000-level version of ECE 4910. It is laboratory-oriented course designed to teach the concepts and tools of cellular neurophysiology, which is cross-listed as ECE and BME, and could be useful to those interested in biological circuits. It uses hands-on experience with extracellular and intracellular electrophysiological techniques, and computer acquisition and analysis of laboratory results. Topics include signal transmission in the nervous system by examining the cellular basis of resting and action potentials, and synaptic transmission and optogenetic control of behavior and physiology. Lecture time is used to review nervous system physiology, introduce laboratory exercises, discuss lab results and primary research papers, and for presentation of additional experimental preparations and methods.
